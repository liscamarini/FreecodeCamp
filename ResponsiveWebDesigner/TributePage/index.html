            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Ada Lovelace life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1815</strong> - London, England - UK</li>
                <li><strong>1829</strong> - Ada was paralyzed after contracting measles, was forced to rest in her bed for almost a year, which affected her ability to walk.</li>
                <li><strong>1833</strong> - Met Charles Babbage</li>
                <li><strong>1835</strong> - She married William Lord King at the age of 20.</li>
                <li><strong>1838</strong> - Became lady Ada Lovelace</li>
                <li><strong>1842</strong> - Babbage asked Lovelace to translate Menabrea's article into English, then adding the translation with the notes she had made herself. Lovelace spent much of the year on this task. These notes, which are more extensive than Menabrea's article, were then published in The Ladies' Diary and in Taylor's Scientific Memorial under the initials "AAL".</li>
                <li><strong>1843</strong> - Translated an article by the Italian military engineer Luigi Federico Menabrea about the machine and complemented it with a set of her own, which she called Annotations. These notes contain an algorithm designed to be processed by machines, which many consider to be the first computer program.</li>
                <li><strong>1851</strong> - Ada died at the same age as her father, aged 36 on November 27 as a result of uterine cancer, probably aggravated by the bleeding performed by doctors.</li>
                <li><strong>1980</strong> - The programming language Ada was created in honor of Ada Lovelace by the United States Department of Defense.</li>
                <li><strong>1981</strong> - The Association of Women in Computing created the Ada Lovelace Award.</li>
                <li><strong>1998</strong> - The British Computing Association created the Lovelace Medal.</li>
                <li><strong>2018</strong> - American Senator Ron Wyden submitted, the October 9, 2018 designation as National Day Ada Lovelace: "Honor the life and contributions of Ada Lovelace as one of the leading women in science and mathematics".</li>
               
            </ul>
